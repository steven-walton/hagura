> "I started out thinking of America as highways and state lines. As I got to know it better, I began to think of it as rivers." - Charles Kuralt

For as long as I can remember, I've had  obsession with rivers.

It wasn't that I spent much time around rivers growing up. I didn't grow up kayaking or rafting, or spending much time on rivers or creeks at all. But I wrote a good deal of bad poetry about them. While playing in a band through high school and college I occasionally tried my hand at songwriting. Inexplicably, I found myself gravitating towards writing about rivers in some fashion in many of my songs.

In university, I ended up studying environmental engineering with a focus in water resources. After graduating, I went to work for a company that specialized in urban whitewater design. That's where I discovered the sport of whitewater kayaking.

September 2016. My first time running a rapid in a kayak. It's was a beginner class III run on the South Platte river. Although the run feels tame to me now, at the time it seemed terrifying. I was completely out of my element. I've never been a great swimmer, so I've always been a bit afraid of water. Paddling into the rapid, I kept wondered to myself, "What the hell am I doing here?"

I reached the bottom of the rapid, but not upright in my kayak. One of the last waves caught my boat and spun me around before flipping me on an eddyline. A rush of icy water, endorphins, and adrenaline. I came out of the water wet, cold, and grinning. I've been addicted ever since.

In the past year since my first kayaking experience, I've been gradually taking on new challenges on the river. I've also busy figuring out what makes the whole thing tick: from the hydraulics of surf waves and sticky holes to the policy decisions that affect whitewater recreation.

My intention for  this blog is to cover a number of river and water resources related topics, some personal and some technical, including:
  * Some of my experiences learning how to kayak
  * Exploration of questions such as, "What makes some holes more retentive than others?"
  * Applications of python programming and data science in hydrology  
  * Discussion of water resource policy
  * Thoughts on various things I'm reading: articles, books, etc.
  * Other random tidbits
