> "I started out thinking of America as highways and state lines. As I got to know it better, I began to think of it as rivers." - Charles Kuralt

For as long as I can remember, I've had a slight obsession with rivers.

It wasn't that I spent much time around rivers growing up. I didn't grow up kayaking or rafting, or spending much time on rivers or creeks at all. But I wrote a good deal of bad poetry about them. While playing in a band through high school and college I occasionally tried my hand at songwriting. I constantly found myself pulled towards incorporating rivers in some fashion into my songs.

I ended up studying environmental engineering in college, with a focus in water resources. After graduating, I went to work for a company that specialized in urban whitewater design. That's where I discovered the sport of whitewater kayaking.

September 2016. My first time running a rapid in a kayak. It's a beginner class III run on the South Platte river. Now the run feels very tame to me, but at the time it seemed terrifying. I was completely out of my element. I've never been a great swimmer, so I've always been a bit afraid of water. I kept wondering to myself, "What the hell am I doing here?"

I reach the bottom of the rapid, but not upright in my kayak. One of the last waves catches my boat and spins me around before flipping me on an eddyline. A rush of icy water, endorphins, and adrenaline. I come out of the water wet, cold, and grinning. I've been addicted ever since.

While I've been learning how to kayak and gradually taking on new challenges on the river, I was also busy figuring out what makes the whole thing ticks: from the hydraulics of surf waves and sticky holes to the policy decisions that affect whitewater recreation.

My intention for  this blog is to cover a number of river and water resources related topics, some personal and some technical, including:
  * Some of my personal experiences learning how to kayak
  * Discussion of water resource policy
  * Exploration of questions such as, "What makes some holes more retentive than others?"
  * Applications of python programming and data science in hydrology  
  * Other random tidbits
